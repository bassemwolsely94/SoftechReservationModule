# Pending owner decisions

Tests that expose a hole whose fix needs the owner's OK (SOFTECH writes, auth, pricing,
checkout) are marked `@pending('P-<n>')` and listed here as `- P-<n>: <one line>`. The marker
comes off the day the fix lands; `PendingTests.test_markers_match_pending_md` keeps this list
and the markers in step.
